==================
basic assignment
==================

a = b.

---

(program
  (assignment
    (name)
    (name)))

==================
assigning expressions
==================

a = 1 + 1.

---

(program
  (assignment
    (name)
    (arithmetic_expression
      (numeric_literal)
      (numeric_literal))))

==================
operator precedence multiplication
==================

a = 1 + 1 * 2.

---

(program
  (assignment
    (name)
    (arithmetic_expression
      (numeric_literal)
      (arithmetic_expression
        (numeric_literal)
        (numeric_literal)))))

==================
operator precedence multiplication
==================

a = 1 + 1 - 1.

(program
  (assignment
    (name)
    (arithmetic_expression
      (arithmetic_expression
        (numeric_literal)
        (numeric_literal))
      (numeric_literal))))

==================
operator precedence all levels
==================

a = 1 ** 1 * 1 + 1.

(program
  (assignment
    (name)
    (arithmetic_expression
      (arithmetic_expression
        (arithmetic_expression
